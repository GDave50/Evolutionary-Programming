# Background
(From Wiki) "The evolution of the peppered moth is an evolutionary instance of directional colour change in the moth population as a consequence of air pollution during the Industrial Revolution. The frequency of dark-coloured moths increased at that time, an example of industrial melanism. Later, when pollution was reduced, the light-coloured form again predominated."

# Reproduction
The genetic algorithm which was implemented reproduces this kind of scenario. A world color is selected in which a population of moths live, which are represented by the colors red, blue and green. When the algorithm is run, a world color is selected and the genetic algorithm is run. Over time, through mutation and crossover, most of the moths turn the same color as the world.
